# Project Overview
This project implements a web application for detecting potato leaf diseases using Streamlit. It leverages machine learning techniques to provide farmers with quick and accurate disease identification, enhancing crop management.

# Objectives
1) Disease Identification: Classify major potato leaf diseases such as Late Blight and Early Blight.
2) User -Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive web app for easy image uploads and instant results.
# Methodology
1) Data Collection: Compile a dataset of healthy and diseased potato leaf images.
2) Preprocessing: Normalize and augment images for model training.
3) Model Development: Utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classification.
4) Deployment: Host the application using Streamlit.
# Tools & Technologies
> Programming Language: Python
> Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Streamlit
> Deployment: Heroku for hosting the web application
# Expected Outcomes
A reliable model for detecting potato leaf diseases.
An accessible web application for farmers to utilize in the field.
# Future Work
Expand the model to include additional diseases.
Enhance the application with real-time detection features.
# Conclusion
This project aims to support farmers in managing potato crops effectively, contributing to improved agricultural practices and food security.
